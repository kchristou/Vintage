        <h2>Description of Testing:</h2>
        <p>
            The product that we want to test in this part is the treasure hunt which is a web application
            and it is targeting mobile devices first and then Desktop Screens.
            It requests data from a server and it implements back a few functions (e.g./list , /leaderboard etc).
            <br>
            <h4>User Acceptance Plan:</h4>
            The application was given to members of the other teams and our class tudors in order for us to have a black box testing
            which will help us to find and identify mistakes.
            <br>
            <u>Some issues that they found:</u> <br>
            ♦ Images Bigger on Computer Screens <br>
            ♦ Some buttons were big and some others small <br>
            ♦ The Link of social media was not linked to the right pages <br>
            <br>
        </p>
