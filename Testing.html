        <h2>Description of Testing:</h2>
        <p>
            The product that we want to test in this part is the treasure hunt which is a web application
            and it is targeting mobile devices first and then Desktop Screens.
            It requests data from a server and it implements back a few functions (e.g./list , /leaderboard etc).
            <br>

            <u> • When the user will do the testing? </u><br>
            When we give the the web-app for testing. <br>
            <br>

            <u> • What happens when a defect (bug) is discovered?</u><br>
            When the users find any problem and mention it to us through our email, social media or even by telling to us face to face
            one of the team members is going to fix it. <br>
            <h4>User Acceptance Plan:</h4>
            The application was given to members of the other teams and our class tudors in order for us to have a black box testing
            which will help us to find and identify mistakes.
            <br>



            <u>Some issues that they found:</u> <br>
            ♦ Images Bigger on Computer Screens <br>
            ♦ Some buttons were big and some others small <br>
            ♦ The Link of social media was not linked to the right pages <br>
            <br>
